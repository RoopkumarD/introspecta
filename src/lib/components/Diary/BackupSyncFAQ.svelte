        0. Why you should backup/sync data to your google drive account?
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>
          The reason i am asking you to store the data in your drive account is
          because if there is some mishap and you delete the browser or clear
          data of it. The diary records saved in the browser also gets deleted.
          To mitigate this, i introduce backing up to google drive feature.

        1. Why do you have to login each time you want to sync?
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>
          No, not each time but each app session. The reason why you have login
          is because i have to show google your consent that you allow me to add
          stuff to your google drive account.

        2. What is an app session?
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>
          This term refers to every time you open this web app. If you use this
          app in multiple tabs, each tab counts as its own separate app session.
          The app session also comes to an end when you either navigate to a
          different page or close the tab. So, every time you start, switch, or
          finish using this app, that's considered a separate app session.

        3. When you should ideally sync/backup data?
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>
          It's completely up to you to decide. If you've written some entries on
          another device and you want to bring those entries into this browser,
          that's a good time to sync. Similarly, if you've finished today's
          reflections and want to ensure your data is safely backed up, you can
          also sync at that point, and so on.
