  hosting service and gathering demographic information.

  We want to make it clear that Introspecta does not actively collect or use
  this information for any purposes beyond the standard operational and security
  requirements of our hosting service. Our use of Vercel is solely for hosting
  the app, and any data logged by Vercel is subject to their own privacy
  policies and practices.
